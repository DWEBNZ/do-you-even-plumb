### Commentary:
Builing this webpage my approach was firstly to block out the site using the bootstrap gridding system to make sure each segment was appropriately positioned, as making changes to layout later on can make css invalid (margins etc.) resulting in more work.
Next I went through each segment and altered the css for each element to match the appearance of the mock up, after this ensuring that the webpage appeared consistent across all screen sizes.
Next a fontawesome script was added to support the social media glyphs from the mock up, and the testimonial bootstrap carousel was added.
Finally, I tested the page across different browsers and fixed a couple of internet explorer errors.
